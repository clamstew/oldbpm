Features we need:
    Handle input for children first then handle input for parent.

UiObject
    Features:
        Adding other UiObjects to this as children.
        Managing screen, relative positioning
        Width, height, and dimension rect
        Input management could go here. Would be based off dimension rect.


Frame
    Features:
        Format children objects
        (May be more effort for what it's worth.)

        a, = one element
        aaaa = one element stretched

        Horizontal Frame
        width: 5
        a, a, a, a, a
        b, b, b

        Vertical Frame
        height: 3
        a, b,
        a, b
        a,

        Horizontal Frame w/ stretching
        (The objects will stretch to the width of the frame)
        width: 5
        max: 3 elements
        aaaaa
        __or with 2 elements
        aa bb
        __or with 4 elements (3 is max so it'll create a new line after 3 objects)
        a b c
        ddddd

        Horizontal Frame w/ adaptive width
        adding elements will format them horizontally but never wrap like default.

        Clipping objects that exceed boundaries of the frame. Also disabling input from objects outside of the frame's boundaries.

    updateLayout():
        Should call after adding or removing children.
        This will update this and child x/y/width/height to the current layout rules.

    override addChild or onAddChild event:
        if this frame is initialized then call updateLayout()

    override removeChild or onRemoveChild event:
        if this frame is initialized then call updateLayout()

    Improve layout creation design

ScrollFrame (vertical) inherits Frame
    Features:
        Calc scroll height.
        Allowing scrolliing to the height by dragging inside the frame.
        Creates a vertical scroll bar.
        Allow scrolling to the height by using the scroll bar.
