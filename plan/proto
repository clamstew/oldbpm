BPM.loop - main loop everything runs here excluding the starting initialization
    BPM.update - everything else
    //update timing (delta) and input
    BPM.render - comes after the update, the last thing that happens every frame

then we have states which will have update and render methods

State
    objects [] - have onCreate, update, render, onRemove
    addList [] - objects to be added on the start of the next frame
    removeList [] - objects to be removed on the start of the next frame
    update - calls update on all objects if it has that method, calls onCreate on objects in addList and removes then from list and puts them in objects, calls onRemove on objects in removeList and removes them from list and objects
    render - calls render on all objects if it has that method
    addObject - adds object to addList
    removeObject - adds object to removeList
