Elemental - located at the Wizard's place?
    Each upgrade has 5 levels of upgrading
    Only 1 upgrade can be active at any time
    These are a big deal - should take some effort to earn

    -P: These are pretty boring for being such a big deal. In addition to these effects it should also grant something new or these should be easier to acquire.


    Fire - each upgrade increases damage
        1 - 10% damage; time- 2 seconds
        2 - 15% damage; time- 3 seconds

Weapons - located at the Blacksmiths' place?
    Each weapon has 4 upgrades; each upgrade can be upgraded 10x
    Easier to obtain than elements

    We can turn these into a tree system by requiring prerequisite upgrades before being able to unlock other upgrades.
    This could help balance extra OP upgrades

    Pin Shooter
        1. Power Pins - x | 6
            Extra big pins for extra big damage
            50% damage increase
            each upgrade increases damage by 10%

        2. Pushback Pins - x | 5
            Pins incur a small push back on bubble
            each upgrade: 10% pushback distance

            -P: Not sure if this would work well with ice.

        3. Protected Pins - x | 7
            Pins take an extra hit to be destroyed (pins bounce off bubbles)
            each upgrade: +1 extra hit

        4. Particle Pins - x | 9
            On collision with a bubble, the pin will shatter into small pins, each damaging bubbles for 25% weapon damage.
            each upgrade: +5% damage


    Rifle
        1. Automatic fire - x | 8
            Can hold mouse down to fire (base-level)
            Shoot speed increases by 10% with every upgrade

        2. Guided Sights - x | 3
            Can see where your shot is headed (think Unicorn ability on Peggle)
            Upgrades increase amount of guideline until 7x
            8. Special! Heat seaking pullets head towards your enemies
            9 & 10. Upgrade pull strength

            -P: Not much use and not worth the trouble programming imo.

    Shotgun
        1. More Pellets - x | 7
            Shoots +1 pellets with every upgrade

        2. Stronger Pellets - x | 6
            Each shotgun pellet increases damage by 5% with every upgrade

        3. Shrapnel Pellets - x | 4
            Each shotgun pellet has a 10% chance to explode into 2 smaller pellets each dealing 25% damage
            Each shrapnel pellet retains its parent's elemental ability
            Each upgrade does the following:
                Increase chance by 10%
                Increase pellet count by 1.3 (every 3 levels get a free pellet)
                Increase damage by 1.5%

            -P: A little too similar to the Pin Shooter upgrade and way better. There's also going to be a ton of shotgun bullets already.
