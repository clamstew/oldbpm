Elemental -

    Each upgrade has 5 levels of upgrading
    Only 1 upgrade can be active at any time
    These are a big deal - should take some effort to earn

    -P: These are pretty boring for being such a big deal. In addition to these effects it should also grant something new or these should be easier to acquire.
    -S: I think they mostly just sound boring. In practice these will be crazy. I also don't want to make things so easy to acquire that you get all of the upgrades and the game gets boring.
        Do you have any ideas?
    -P: I was thinking these could be like talent trees. But weapons seem to be like that already. I don't know we should be able to play around with it, just gotta implement it.

    Elements have a base ability and 4 unlockable abilities.


    Fire - each upgrade increases damage
        Base Ability Increase

        Viral Fire - x | 9

            Each upgrade increases chance to ignite.

        Embers - x | 8
            Each bubble on fire has a chance to shoot a small fireball which ignites bubbles and deals small damage.
            Each upgrade:
                Increases the amount of bubbles it can affect before destroying by 1
                Increases damage of ember by small percentage

        Fire Burst - x | 5
            When a bubble catches on fire there will be a small chance to active the fire burst event:
                When activated a prompt will tell you to quickly double click
                If successful then a giant burst of fire will occur near the bubble that caught fire
                this burst will cause significant damage and light all bubbles on fire

                Each upgrade increases the chance of this event.

        1 - 10% damage; time- 2 seconds
        2 - 15% damage; time- 3 seconds

        Initial ability: Strong shock damage

        Chain Lightning - x | 9
            When a bubble is attacked with an element it will send a stream of lightning to the nearest bubble dealing strong damage.
            Each upgrade allows for multiple streams a -> b -> c -> d

        Conduction - x | 7
            If a bubble which is affected by electricity comes into contact with an armorless bubble then it will cause a shockwave dealing AoE damage.
            Each upgrade increases damage and AoE

        Charging - x | 8
            When a pin collides with a bubble and succesfully applies electricity, it will increase the speed of the pin and the life of the pin by a small amount.

Weapons
    Each weapon has 4 upgrades; each upgrade can be upgraded 10x
    Easier to obtain than elements

    We can turn these into a tree system by requiring prerequisite upgrades before being able to unlock other upgrades.
    This could help balance extra OP upgrades

    Pin Shooter - Technique shots
        1. Exploding Pins - 7 | 6
            Exploding pins for extra big damage
            50% damage increase
            each upgrade increases damage by 10%

        2. Pushback Pins - 5 | 0
            Pins incur a small push back on bubble
            each upgrade: 10% pushback distance

            -P: Not sure if this would work well with ice.

        3. Protected Pins - 7 | 7
            Pins take an extra hit to be destroyed (pins bounce off bubbles)
            each upgrade: +1 extra hit

        4. Particle Pins - 8 | 9
            On collision with a bubble, the pin will shatter into small pins, each damaging bubbles for 25% weapon damage.
            each upgrade: +5% damage


    Rifle - Single fast and strong shots
        1. Automatic fire - 9 | 8
            Can hold mouse down to fire (base-level)
            Shoot speed increases by 10% with every upgrade

        2. Guided Sights - 0 | 3
            Can see where your shot is headed (think Unicorn ability on Peggle)
            Upgrades increase amount of guideline until 7x
            8. Special! Heat seaking pullets head towards your enemies
            9 & 10. Upgrade pull strength

            -P: Not much use and not worth the trouble programming imo.
            -S: I agree

        3. Armor piercing shots - x | 7
            Increases damage of bullet by 10% with each upgrade

        4. Recoil - x | 8
            -P: This would be really good for rifles since they are fast they should be able to bounce more than other bullets.
            When a shot bounces of the edges it will increase the shots damage by 1%, can stack up to 100


    Shotgun - Spread shots
        1. More Pellets - 8 | 7
            Shoots +1 pellets with every upgrade

        2. Stronger Pellets - 6 | 5
            Each shotgun pellet increases damage by 3% with every upgrade

        3. Shrapnel Pellets - 2 | 4
            Each shotgun pellet has a 10% chance to explode into 2 smaller pellets each dealing 25% damage
            Each shrapnel pellet retains its parent's elemental ability
            Each upgrade does the following:
                Increase chance by 10%
                Increase pellet count by 1.3 (every 3 levels get a free pellet)
                Increase damage by 1.5%

            -P: A little too similar to the Pin Shooter upgrade and way better. There's also going to be a ton of shotgun bullets already.
            -S: Yeah, good point

        4. Increase Range - x | 7
            Increases the distance between each pellet with each shot. 45 degrees by default, 80 degrees max. Shots should be be placed like so if you're pointing at a 90 degree angle:
                first - 90
                second - 90 - 45
                third - 90 + 45
                    Any additional pellets should be between first-second and first-third
