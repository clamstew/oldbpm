Elemental -

    Each upgrade has 5 levels of upgrading
    Only 1 upgrade can be active at any time
    These are a big deal - should take some effort to earn

    -P: These are pretty boring for being such a big deal. In addition to these effects it should also grant something new or these should be easier to acquire.
    -S: I think they mostly just sound boring. In practice these will be crazy. I also don't want to make things so easy to acquire that you get all of the upgrades and the game gets boring.
        Do you have any ideas?
    -P: I was thinking these could be like talent trees. But weapons seem to be like that already. I don't know we should be able to play around with it, just gotta implement it.

    -P: Some of these abilities are unbalanced or some seem like super abilities. I'm thinking that you initially choose one then you have to reach a certain amount of upgrades on that one to get another one.
        So if we follow that then you can get the seemingly really good abilities like the board wipe ones at the start. So either we have to nerf them or make them on their own tier.
        Maybe we could something like I said previously but for the board wipe stuff or whatever, that stuff will need all of the other upgrades (not fully upgraded just the first upgrades for each one).

    -S: Yeah, I think we should make a tier system of some sort with these. It'd be more fun to have stronger abilities later in the game too.

    Elements have a base ability and 4 unlockable abilities.


    Fire - each upgrade increases damage
        Initial Ability: Damage over time

        Viral Fire - 9 | 9
            - Bubbles have a chance to light each other on fire
            Each upgrade increases chance to ignite.

        Embers - 8 | 8
            Each bubble on fire has a chance to shoot a small fireball which ignites bubbles and deals small damage.
            Each upgrade:
                Increases the amount of bubbles it can affect before destroying by 1
                Increases damage of ember by small percentage
                Increases range of the fire ball allowing it to reach bubbles farther away

        Stoking the Fire - 7 | 7
            Each upgrade increases:
                Fire DOT damage
                Duration of fire

        Fire Burst - 2 | 5
            When a bubble catches on fire there will be a small chance to active the fire burst event:
                When activated a prompt will tell you to quickly double click
                If successful then a giant burst of fire will occur near the bubble that caught fire
                this burst will cause significant damage and light all bubbles on fire

                Each upgrade increases the chance of this event.

        Fire Dragon - 8 | 5
            If X bullets collide with bubble in Y seconds, there is a Z percent chance that
                A dragon-shaped flame ball will burst from the bubble instantly killing the bubble
                and will fly straight up, out of igniting and dealing large amounts of damage to any bubble in its path

                Each upgrade
                    decreases X
                    increases Y
                    increases Z
                    increases amount of damage done by dragon

    Lightning - each upgrade increases chain amount
        Initial ability: Strong shock damage

        Chain Lightning - 9 | 9
            When a bubble is attacked with an element it will send a stream of lightning to the nearest bubble dealing strong damage.
            Each upgrade allows for multiple streams a -> b -> c -> d

        Conduction - 8 | 7
            If a bubble which is affected by electricity comes into contact with an armorless bubble then it will cause a shockwave dealing AoE damage.
            Each upgrade increases damage and AoE

        Charging - 9 | 8
            When a pin collides with a bubble and succesfully applies electricity, it will increase the speed of the pin and the life of the pin by a small amount.
            Each upgrade increases the amount of speed and pin life

            -S: This would require a reflecting bullet or something, otherwise this does nothing as the bullet will die on collision. revision:
                After successfully applying electricity onto a bubble, gain a buff affecting all future bullets for X seconds
                    Increase speed
                    Increase the life
                    Small chance for AoE shockwave on every collision

                Each upgrade increases the strength of all buff bonuses and/or length of buff

            -P: Yeah I didn't think of that. The revision sounds much better.

        Overload - 8 | 5
            Devastating board wipe
            Chance to shoot lightning onto every bubble on screen
            - Click as many times as you can when you see visual indicator
            - Increase combo by func(amount of clicks)
            - Damage dealt to every bubble is based on combo after bonus


    Ice - each upgrade decreases bubble speed
        Initial ability: Slows bubble by percentage for limited time

        Black Ice - 7 | 7
            Increases the speed reduction for bubbles and length of freeze
            Final upgrade completely freezes bubbles

        Evasive Cold - 7 | 6
            Pushes bubbles back with each hit and causes small AoE damage.
            Each upgrade increases AoE and pushback

            -S: revision: 9 | x
                AoE only if you hit a bubble that is affected by ice

        Brittle Bubbles - 9 | 8
            Damaging an already frozen bubbles gives a large percentage increase to damage.
            Each upgrade increases damage

        Explosive Shatter - 7 | x - prereq: Brittle Bubbles, Black Ice
            If a bubble is frozen by last upgrade of Black Ice and killed by Brittle Bubbles, explode into a large amount of deadly ice shards dealing heavy damage
            Each shard inflicts the bonuses of Brittle Bubbles and Black Ice on the bubble it collides with
            ? Shards last until collided with (may be too OP)

    ## 1 Secret Elements after you beat the game the first time
    // meh, needs improvement
    Death (secret) - each upgrade increases chance of insta-kill
        1 - 10% chance of insta-kill
        2 - 20% chance of insta-kill
        3 - 30% chance of insta-kill
        4 - 40% chance of insta-kill
        5 - 50% chance of insta-kill

* all perks are active all the time - passive skills
Perks - located where? Wizards tower

    0 | 2 - +30% chance to execute element abilities
        -S: Idk about this; should elements be applied on chance? You were saying the game feels broken when it's like this; it would feel like the cooldown effect I had implemented earlier.
        -P: There's a chance to apply the element to the bubble right? You were opting for the chance instead of the cooldown in order to fix the broke feeling. I still think it feels broken either with cooldown or chance but we need some kind of nerf. I don't like this perk much anymore.
        -S: Oh, no. I'm implementing a chance of spreading fire from bubble to bubble - that's the most overpowered thing. I think you should apply the element with every shot.
            If they are too strong, we can just make the elemental damage weaker. Or in the case of fire, reduce the duration or something.

    9 | 9 - Bullets bounce off bubbles with armor rather than getting destroyed.
                -P: I like this as a perk so that all bullets have a chance of doing this.
                -S: I noticed the Lightning ability charging is kind of based on this (not sure if intended - see my revision), but I do like this as a perk.


    9 | 9 - Multiplier will also affect bullet damage. (each multiplier will increase damage by 10%)
        -S: Upgradeable; each upgrade increases amount of damage. I say we start with 1 - 3%

// Blacksmith

Weapons
    Each weapon has 4 upgrades; each upgrade can be upgraded 10x
    Easier to obtain than elements

    We can turn these into a tree system by requiring prerequisite upgrades before being able to unlock other upgrades.
    This could help balance extra OP upgrades

    Pin Shooter - Technique shots
        1. Exploding Pins - 7 | 6
            Exploding pins for extra big damage
            50% damage increase
            each upgrade increases damage by 10%

        X    2. Pushback Pins - 0 | 0
                Pins incur a small push back on bubble
                each upgrade: 10% pushback distance

                -P: Not sure if this would work well with ice.
                -S: Nope; we'll need a new #2.

        2.

        X   3. Protected Pins - 0 | 0
                Pins take an extra hit to be destroyed (pins bounce off bubbles)
                each upgrade: +1 extra hit

                -S: Perk ability

        3.

        4. Particle Pins - 8 | 9
            On collision with a bubble, the pin will shatter into small pins, each damaging bubbles for 25% weapon damage.
            each upgrade: +5% damage


    Rifle - Single fast and strong shots
        1. Automatic fire - 9 | 8
            Can hold mouse down to fire (base-level)
            Shoot speed increases by 10% with every upgrade

        3. Armor piercing shots - 9 | 7
            Increases damage of bullet by 10% with each upgrade
            Final upgrade: additional 10% chance of removing armor

        4. Recoil - 9 | 8
            When a shot bounces of the edges it will increase the shots damage by 1%, can stack up to 100
                -P: This would be really good for rifles since they are fast they should be able to bounce more than other bullets.
                -S: I like it! Good idea. Should also have a visual indication of strength; maybe color?


    Shotgun - Spread shots
        1. More Pellets - 8 | 7
            Shoots +1 pellets with every upgrade

        2. Stronger Pellets - 6 | 5
            Each shotgun pellet increases damage by 3% with every upgrade


        4. Increase Range - 4 | 0
            Increases the distance between each pellet with each shot. 45 degrees by default, 80 degrees max. Shots should be be placed like so if you're pointing at a 90 degree angle:
                first - 90
                second - 90 - 45
                third - 90 + 45
                    Any additional pellets should be between first-second and first-third
            -P: This seems lame to me now. If you were to invest in this upgrade first it'd be really boring and almost useless. This is only good with more pellets, so maybe put this in 'More Pellets'.
            -S: Yeah, we could implicitly add this to 'More Pellets' or it could be unlocked after upgrading 'More Pellets'.
