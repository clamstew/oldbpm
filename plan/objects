        g.setDepth(-10);
        myObj.addRender(g);
        //Then when myObj is removed 'g' is also removed automatically
*/

    state //the state this object belongs to

    onCreate //Called when added to the state
    onRemove //Called when removed from the state
        Remove all _renderable instances in renderList from the states renderList

    addRender(_renderable)
        Adds to renderList
