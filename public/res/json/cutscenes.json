So when text exceeds a certain line limit we create a new phase ahead of this phase which contains the rest of the text. This is useful so you don't have to create a new phase manually and check back and forth to see if the text even passes the line limit. Hm, this is holding quite a bit of text. Hopefully this feature will actually be used, but this much text is kinda ugly. So I'm not sure. Wow still going eh? Hm I might have to start speaking gibberish like goaa;lj l;kaset asldfk jwtixzc jasdlkt asdf. Oh wait it just started working! Yay so this is text partitioning. "
