=== Ideas on how to improve rendering performance. ===

Rasterize the glare and bubble textures into one texture. Either do this manually or through Pixi. Use PIXI.RenderTexture

When a bubble has armor and it is not damaged, put it into a unique batch for its texture. When it gets damaged remove it from the batch and add it normally, then add the crack movie clip to the armor.

Combining the armors into one texture could improve performance. I'm not sure how Pixi does it, but when I worked with OpenGL binding only one texture and using texture coords to slice was faster than binding separate textures.
